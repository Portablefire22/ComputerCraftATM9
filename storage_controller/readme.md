# Storage Controller
Ever thought that Applied Energistics 2 ME Systems or Refined Storage systems were just too simple and too clean looking?

Ever wanted a 100 x 50 block storage system that is the equivalent of half a ME disk drive filled with 64 drives?

Well are you in luck!

By using the Create mod in conjucntion with ComputerCraft, I have created a storage system similar to a tape drive system. 

## How does it work?
The storage system functions with a grid of Create vaults and the centre slot is used to read the contents of an inserted Vault. In operation the player will query for an item, the system will locate the most convinient use location of that item (prioritising lowering storage use), insert the selected vault(s) into the centre slot, and provide the items to the player.

## Why?
BECAUSE MAKING AN ME SYSTEM IN COMPUTERCRAFT HAS BEEN ON MY MIND FOR 8 YEARS AND I'VE ONLY NOW LOST THE SANITY REQUIRED TO MAKE ME REALISE THAT IT WOULD BE A BAD IDEA
