This Repo is to contain code for the various computercraft systems that are running on my private AllTheMods9 server.

I'm using this instead of pastebin for sending files to the turtles, which is why the repo has like 40 commits per day. I don't think there is another way for me to do this so unfortunately I do have to make a commit for every single change I do to the code, even if the code is purely to debug something small.

The systems that these programs are designed for are not provided but the programs are typically designed with the idea of expansion, so you should be able to recreate them if needed.
